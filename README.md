This repository provides a basic calculation process for vehicle emissions based on MOVES emission rate (can be derived from MOVES platform)
To run the code, you should prepare:
- Emission rate table specifying the vehicle type, model year, emission type, operating mode (derived from MOVES)
- Fleet share table specifying the proportion of different vehicle sizes in the study domain
- Vehicle trajectory as the base input for the emission estimation
